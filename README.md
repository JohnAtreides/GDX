<sub>Merge two FIT, GPX, TCX.. files :) </sub>

## A Garmin TCX file is an XML-based file format that is used to store activity data, such as GPS coordinates, heart rate, and other sensor data. Here is a brief overview of the structure of a Garmin TCX file:

1. Header: The header contains information about the creator of the TCX file, such as the device and software used to create the file, as well as the activity type and the start time of the activity.

2. Activity: The activity section contains information about the activity, such as the sport type, distance, and duration.

3. Lap: The lap section contains information about individual laps within the activity, including lap distance, time, and average speed.

4. Track: The track section contains information about the GPS coordinates and other sensor data for the activity, including time, distance, and elevation.

5. Extensions: The extensions section can contain additional data, such as heart rate variability, that is not included in the standard TCX format.
